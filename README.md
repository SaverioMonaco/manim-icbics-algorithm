# Visualization of "I can't believe it can sort" algorithm
Attempt to understand why the following algorithm works:

**Algorithm:** $ICanâ€™tBelieveItCanSort(A[1..n])$
$\rule{8cm}{.01cm}$
**for $i=1$ to $n$ do**
**$\quad$ for $j=1$ to $n$ do**
**$\quad\quad$ if $A[i] < A[j]$ then**
$\quad\quad\quad$ swap $A[i]$ and $A[j]$
